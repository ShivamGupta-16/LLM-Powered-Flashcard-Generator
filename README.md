## Sample Execution
This section demonstrates a typical workflow using the provided sample PDF: APznzaZUdlapAFWUKFjr-5SnuYRG6kF2yZKssJDVbSPfPu3DM0l4x72p_yOKHEvc_TN7aMtuLit-RwulHzqllkfWqbdvNB-VxVVmEbEEkLv9orKDSKz_voCV6lmoy1mxCY-BXkTHXsBdVlxssw9uYgF1Mj5nu7vDh3S67AAXU3zSMpQQRtp8FkK07u1bY-0B9GUyPwsmaEYLt.pdf.

1. Generating Flashcards from PDF Content:

Upload a document related to Computer Networks and click "Generate Flashcards". The app processes the content using Gemini and creates flashcards grouped by topic (e.g., OSI Model, IP Addressing, Routing Protocols).

Example Flashcard (Front - Question):

Q: What is the purpose of the OSI model?
A: It standardizes networking functions into seven layers to ensure interoperability between systems.

2. Translating Flashcards:

Q: What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
A: TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, while UDP is faster but connectionless and less reliable.

Example Translated Flashcard (Hindi):

Q: OSI ‡§Æ‡•â‡§°‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à?
A: ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§®‡•á‡§ü‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡§æ‡§§ ‡§™‡§∞‡§§‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ú‡§ø‡§∏‡§∏‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§® ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§£‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∂‡•Ä‡§≤‡§§‡§æ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§®‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡•§

3. Searching for an Answer:

You can also search for specific answers within the uploaded content. For instance, if you type "Why is the OSI model important?" into the search bar, you‚Äôll get a direct and accurate answer based on the document's content.

Example Search Result:

Answer
The OSI model is important because it standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers, enabling interoperability among different systems and protocols.
